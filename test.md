## Creating an IBM Cloud Account

**Estimated Effort:** 15 minutes

### Lab overview:

To access the resources and services that the IBM Cloud provides, you need an IBM Cloud Account. This lab will take you through step-by-step instructions to create one.

### Objective(s):

After completing this lab, you will be able to:
* Create an IBM Cloud Trial Account using a Feature Code

### Prerequisite:

Please ensure you click on the **\"Launch App\"** button from the previous section of this lab to get a feature code and activate the trial account before moving forward with the lab instructions. These instructions will help you create an IBM Cloud account.

> **Note:** These instructions only apply to creating a **NEW** IBM Cloud account using an email address that you have not used previously to create another IBM Cloud account. If you have already used your IBM Cloud feature code in another course/lab to create an IBM Cloud account, please skip this lab, as the code can only be used once.

## Activate Trial Account

1. The previous section of the lab is the first step for activating your IBM Cloud trial account using Feature Code.

2. On clicking on the `Launch App` button, you will get a unique code.

3. Next, click on Activate Your Trial. It will redirect you to the IBM Cloud registration page, to create an account on IBM Cloud.

## Ways To Troubleshoot

If you encounter any of the below errors while activating your IBM Cloud trial account, please follow the steps as instructed below.

- Ooops snap! The promotional codes for IBM Cloud are very popular and have temporarily run out. Please check back soon.

    **Reason** - It takes 24 to 48 hours to populate news feature codes.

    **Solution** - Please try again later

- Something went wrong error.

    **Reason** - This could be because you have already applied a code to this email earlier or your domain/country/IP is restricted.

    **Solution** - Try from another email id

- Feature code expired.

    **Reason** - You may have applied the feature code already once.

    **Solution** - Create a new IBM cloud account and write to the support team as per the instructions below.

- If your trial ends.

    **Reason** - Trial accounts are valid only for 6 months, and the same feature code cannot be applied again.

    **Solution** - Create a new IBM cloud account and write to the support team as per the instructions below.

## Other Possible Solutions:

- Try clearing your browser\'s cache and cookies
- Try from a different browser on an incognito mode.

If you still face any issues, please write an email to support@cognitiveclass.ai with the following details

**Subject Line:** Feature Code Issue

**Email Content:**

- Name of the course you are undertaking.
- The course link where you obtained the feature code.
- The feature code you are trying to apply.
- The error message that it is shown.
- The email ID used to create the IBM Cloud account.
- Your username.

Once you obtain a new feature code, you can create a new account using a different Email ID.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your IBM Cloud Account!


The `.` here refers to the current directory. You are telling Linux to execute the script `greet.sh` and that it can be found in the current directory.

---

## Practice exercise

1.  Create a script named `greetnew.sh` that takes the first and last names of the user, saves them in corresponding variables `firstname` and `lastname`, and prints a welcome message, such as `"Hello <firstname> <lastname>"`.

> Use the `read` command and `echo` commands. Write comments. Make sure to add the shebang line.

> Step 1: Create a new file named `greetnew.sh`.

> Step 2: Add the following lines to the file:

```
#! /bin/bash

# This script accepts the user\'s name and prints 
# a message greeting the user

# Print the prompt message on screen
echo -n "Enter your firstname :"	  	

# Wait for user to enter a name, and save the entered name into the variable \'name\'
read firstname				

# Print the prompt message on screen
echo -n "Enter your lastname :"	  	

# Wait for user to enter a name, and save the entered name into the variable \'name\'
read lastname	

# Print the welcome message followed by the name	
echo "Hello $firstname $lastname."

```

> Step 3: Save the file.

> Step 4: Add the execute permission to `greetnew.sh` for the owner:

```
chmod u+x greetnew.sh
```

> Step 5: Execute the file from the command prompt using the following command:

```
./greetnew.sh
```

### Summary

In this lab, you learned how to:
- Create and execute a simple Bash shell script
- Implement the shebang directive `#! /bin/bash` in a Bash shell script
