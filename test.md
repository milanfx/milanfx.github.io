# Create your IBM Cloud Account

**Estimated Time Needed: 15 Minutes**

### Overview

To access the resources and services that the IBM Cloud provides, you need an IBM Cloud Account. This lab will take you through step-by-step instructions to create one.

### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create an IBM Cloud Trial Account using a Feature Code

### Prerequisite

Please ensure you click on the **\"Launch App\"** button from the previous section of this lab to get a feature code and activate the trial account before moving forward with the lab instructions. These instructions will help you create an IBM Cloud account.

> **Note:** These instructions only apply to creating a **NEW** IBM Cloud account using an email address that you have not used previously to create another IBM Cloud account. If you have already used your IBM Cloud feature code in another course/lab to create an IBM Cloud account, please skip this lab, as the code can only be used once.

### Activate Trial Account

- The previous section of the lab is the first step for activating your IBM Cloud trial account using Feature Code.
- On clicking on the `Launch App` button, you will get a unique code.
- Next, click on Activate Your Trial. It will redirect you to the IBM Cloud registration page, to create an account on IBM Cloud.
