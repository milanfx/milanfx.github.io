# Excel Getting Started

**Estimated Time Needed: 20 Minutes**

### Overview

Microsoft Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet software even three decades after its initial release. For all these years it has been available as a standard application that needed to be installed on your desktop; but it is not just a desktop app anymore. Now, you can even use Excel when you're online by using 'Excel for the web' - and run it right in your web browser without installing anything on your desktop!

'Excel for the web' (sometimes referred to as Excel Online) can be used at no charge as part of a free Microsoft account. Although it does not have all of the capabilities of the desktop and paid online versions, the free web version provides many of the key features.

### Software Used in this Lab

The instruction videos in this course use the full Excel Desktop version as this has all the available product features, but for the hands-on labs we will be using the free 'Excel for the web' version as this is available to everyone.

Although you can use the Excel Desktop software if you have access to this version, <ins>it is recommended that you use Excel for the web for the hands-on labs</ins> as the lab instructions specifically refer to this version, and there are some small differences in the interface and available features.

### Dataset Used in this Lab

The dataset used in this lab comes from the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/indian-startup-funding under a **[CC0: Public Domain license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**. 
Acknowledgement and thanks also goes to https://trak.in who were generous enough to share the data publicly for free.

We are using a modified subset of that dataset for the lab, so to follow the lab instructions successfully please use the dataset provided with the lab, rather than the dataset from the original source.
