### Topic01 - Importance of Data Measurement for Business Improvement

- **Main Ideas:**  
  - **Data Measurement** enables companies to evaluate and enhance their **Performance**, **Costs**, and **Profits** through informed decision-making.  

- **Core Notes:**  
  - **Businesses** must measure their **Operations** to improve or optimize outcomes.  
  - **Measurement** of **Costs** allows identification and reduction of unnecessary expenses.  
  - **Measurement** of **Profits** helps determine strategies to enhance profitability.  
  - **Data Recording** provides the foundation for **Performance Evaluation** and **Strategic Planning**.  
  - Example:  
      - A company should analyze whether **80% of Revenue** comes from **20% of Customers** to identify key client groups.  

### Topic02 - Necessity of Data Collection and Archiving

- **Main Ideas:**  
  - **Data Collection** and **Archiving** are fundamental steps for any company aiming to adopt **Data Analytics** or **Data Science** practices.  

- **Core Notes:**  
  - **Organizations** must begin **Capturing Data** immediately if not already doing so.  
  - **Data Archiving** ensures that no information is lost or overwritten.  
  - **Old Data** retains long-term value, even if it is **100 Years Old**, as it provides historical insights.  
  - **Data Consistency** is essential for future interpretation and analysis.  
  - **Documentation** should accompany data storage to maintain **Transparency** and **Traceability**.  
  - Example:  
      - A company that has operated for decades should retain all past **Cost Data** and **Sales Records** for future analysis.  

### Topic03 - Implementation of Best Practices in Data Management

- **Main Ideas:**  
  - **Best Practices** in **Data Management** ensure data reliability, accessibility, and usability for long-term business and analytical success.  

- **Core Notes:**  
  - **Data Archiving Standards** should be established at the **Start of the Business**.  
  - **Existing Companies** should implement **Archiving Policies** immediately if missing.  
  - **Data Management Systems** must support **Data Retrieval** and **Version Control**.  
  - **Proper Documentation** guarantees that future analysts can interpret the data accurately.  
  - **Consistency** across data sources ensures **Reliability** for **Analytical Models**.  
  - Example:  
      - Businesses should adopt **Centralized Data Storage Systems** with metadata tagging to maintain clarity.  

### Topic04 - Significance of Data Quality in Data Science

- **Main Ideas:**  
  - **Data Quality** directly determines the success of **Data Science Applications**; poor-quality data leads to inaccurate results.  

- **Core Notes:**  
  - **Data Science Value** depends on the **Quality of Collected Data**.  
  - **Garbage In, Garbage Out** principle emphasizes that flawed data produces unreliable insights.  
  - **Data Cleaning** is crucial for companies with existing datasets.  
  - **New Companies** must focus on **Accurate and Systematic Data Collection**.  
  - **Measurement Systems** should be standardized before analytical processes begin.  
  - Example:  
      - Before applying **Machine Learning Models**, organizations should ensure data is **Complete**, **Consistent**, and **Error-Free**.  

### Topic05 - Role of Data Science Teams in Organizational Success
