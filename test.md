### 1. Define what a Data Repository is and describe its purpose

- **Main Ideas:**
  - A data repository is a structured environment for storing, managing, and retrieving data.
  - It serves as the foundation for reporting, analytics, and business operations.

- **Core Notes:**  
  - A **Data Repository** is a system that collects and organizes data for future use in **operations** or **analysis**.  
  - It can range from a **single database** to a **large-scale infrastructure** containing multiple databases.  
  - The main goal is to **isolate, organize, and maintain** data to ensure it is accessible and analyzable.  
  - Data repositories enhance the **efficiency**, **credibility**, and **accuracy** of data reporting and analytics.

### 2. Distinguish between Databases, Data Warehouses, and Big Data Stores

- **Main Ideas:**
    - These three types of repositories differ in structure, purpose, and scale.
    - Each serves specific organizational needs, from daily transactions to large-scale analytics.

- **Core Notes:**  
    - **Databases:**  
        - Designed for **input, storage, search, retrieval, and modification** of data.  
        - Managed by a **Database Management System (DBMS)** that allows querying and updates.  
        - Example query: finding customers inactive for six months.  
        - Suitable for **operational data** and **transactional systems**.  
    - **Data Warehouses:**  
        - Serve as **central repositories** integrating data from multiple sources.  
        - Use the **ETL Process** (Extract, Transform, Load) to consolidate data into a single analytical database.  
        - Support **analytics** and **business intelligence (BI)** tasks.  
        - Traditionally built on **relational models**, though **non-relational** approaches are increasingly used.  
    - **Big Data Stores:**  
        - Designed for **massive, distributed data processing and storage**.  
        - Handle **high-volume**, **high-velocity**, and **high-variety** data.  
        - Commonly used in contexts involving **cloud computing**, **IoT**, and **social media** data streams.  

### 3. Compare Relational (RDBMS) and Non-Relational (NoSQL) databases

- **Main Ideas:**
    - Relational databases follow structured schemas; non-relational databases offer flexibility and scalability.
    - The choice depends on data type, structure, and performance needs.

- **Core Notes:**  
    - **Relational Databases (RDBMS):**  
        - Organize data into **tables (rows and columns)** with **defined schemas**.  
        - Use **Structured Query Language (SQL)** for data management.  
        - Optimized for **complex queries** and **transactions** involving multiple tables.  
        - Examples: **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Oracle Database**.  
    - **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):**  
        - ‚ÄúNot Only SQL‚Äù systems supporting **schema-less**, **flexible** data structures.  
        - Designed for **speed**, **scalability**, and **variety** of data types.  
        - Essential for handling **unstructured** or **semi-structured data** (e.g., JSON, key-value pairs).  
        - Examples: **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, **Couchbase**, **HBase**.  
    - **Use Cases:**  
        - RDBMS ‚Üí Best for **structured enterprise data** and **transactional systems**.  
        - NoSQL ‚Üí Best for **Big Data**, **IoT**, and **cloud-based distributed systems**.  

### 4. Explain the ETL Process and its role in data integration

- **Main Ideas:**
    - The ETL process integrates data from multiple sources into a unified repository.
    - It ensures data consistency and readiness for analysis.

- **Core Notes:**  
    - **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** is a three-step process:  
        1. **Extract** ‚Äì Gather data from multiple internal and external sources.  
        2. **Transform** ‚Äì Clean, validate, and convert data into a standardized, usable format.  
        3. **Load** ‚Äì Insert transformed data into the **Data Warehouse** or **Repository**.  
    - ETL improves **data quality** and ensures that datasets are **consistent**, **accurate**, and **analysis-ready**.  
    - Modern ETL processes often include **real-time streaming** and **cloud integration**.  
    - ETL forms the backbone of **business intelligence pipelines**, enabling unified data insights.  

### 5. Describe how Data Repositories support Analytics and Business Intelligence

- **Main Ideas:**
    - Data repositories enable efficient data analysis, visualization, and decision-making.
    - They form the core of enterprise data management strategies.

- **Core Notes:**  
    - Repositories isolate and structure data to make **reporting** and **analytics** easier and more credible.  
    - They support **querying**, **trend analysis**, **data mining**, and **machine learning** applications.  
    - **Data Warehouses** act as the analytical hub, enabling **organization-wide access** to unified data.  
    - **Big Data Stores** expand analytical capacity to include **real-time insights** and **massive data volumes**.
