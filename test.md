## Lab: Load data into the IBM Db2 database from a CSV file

### **Lab Overview:**

Now that you have learned about the process of importing data into a data repository from varied sources, you will load data from a CSV file into the IBM Db2 database instance you created in the previous lab.

**Estimated time needed:** 15 minutes

### **Dataset used in this exercise:**

The dataset used in this exercise comes from the following source: [https://www.kaggle.com/antfarol/car-sale-advertisements](https://www.kaggle.com/antfarol/car-sale-advertisements) under a [CC0: Public Domain license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). We are using a modified subset of that dataset for this lab. To follow the lab instructions successfully, please use the dataset provided with this exercise rather than the dataset from the original source.

**NOTE:** The lab assumes that you have downloaded this CSV file: [exercise03_car_sales_data.csv](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/exercise03_car_sales_data.csv) to your local system.

Please follow the steps given below to provision your instance of IBM Db2 on Cloud.

**Step1:** Go to: [https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/db2](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/db2?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork) to access your Db2 dashboard on Cloud.

**Step2:** If youâ€™re not already logged in to your IBM Cloud Lite account, click on **Log in** at the bottom right of the screen to log in.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-1.png" width="400"></div>

**Step3:** Logging in will take you to your **Db2 service dashboard**.

Click on **view existing** link in the **Existing Lite plan instance** box.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-2.png" width="400"></div> 

**Step4:** The **Manage** tab will be active by default in your services dashboard. Click on **Go to UI**.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-3.png" width="800"></div> 

**Step5:** Now click on the menu bar icon in the top left corner of your Db2 service dashboard.

Click on **Load** **>** **Load Data**.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-4.png" width="800"></div> 

**Step6:** You can either drag and drop the CSV file into the **File selection** box, or you can click on the **browse files** link, also provided in the **File selection** box to browse your local folders to find and open the downloaded CSV file.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-5.png" width="800"></div> 

The name of the CSV file you have uploaded will appear in the **Selected file** section on the right.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-6.png" width="800"></div> 

Click **Next** to proceed.

**Step7:** You will be asked to select a **Schema** from a list of schema names.

**NOTE:** Select the schema name with a random mix of alphabets and numbers. It will be similar to, but not the same as, the one you see in the screenshot below (_MGJ73335_). The ones that you do NOT have to select are AUDIT, DB2INST1, ERRORSCHEMA, and ST_INFORMTN_SCHEMA (and sometimes you might also see SQLxxxxx as well).

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-7.png" width="800"></div>

**Step8:** Click on **New Table**.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-8.png" width="800"></div> 

**Step9:** Enter the name **CARSALESTABLE** in the input box prompting you with **_NEW TABLE NAME_**.

**Note:** You will be using this table name in the SQL queries you will execute in the next exercise.

Now click on **Create** to create the new table.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-9.png" width="800"></div> 

**Step10:** A table by the name of **CARSALESTABLE** has been created.

Click **Next** at the bottom right of the page to proceed.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-10.png" width="800"></div> 

**Step11:** Click **Next** to proceed.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-11.png" width="800"></div>

**Step12:** Then click **Begin Load** to begin the process of loading the data from the CSV into your database.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-12.png" width="800"></div> 

**Step13:** Data from your CSV file is now loaded into your Db2 instance.

<div align="center"><img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0100EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/images/Figure_3-13.png" width="800"></div> 

Congratulations! You have successfully loaded data from a CSV file into the IBM Db2 instance you created in the previous lab.

## Ways To Troubleshoot

If you encounter any of the below errors while activating your IBM Cloud trial account, please follow the steps as instructed below.

- Ooops snap! The promotional codes for IBM Cloud are very popular and have temporarily run out. Please check back soon.

    **Reason** - It takes 24 to 48 hours to populate news feature codes.

    **Solution** - Please try again later

- Something went wrong error.

    **Reason** - This could be because you have already applied a code to this email earlier or your domain/country/IP is restricted.

    **Solution** - Try from another email id

- Feature code expired.

    **Reason** - You may have applied the feature code already once.

    **Solution** - Create a new IBM cloud account and write to the support team as per the instructions below.

- If your trial ends.

    **Reason** - Trial accounts are valid only for 6 months, and the same feature code cannot be applied again.

    **Solution** - Create a new IBM cloud account and write to the support team as per the instructions below.

## Other Possible Solutions:

- Try clearing your browser\'s cache and cookies
- Try from a different browser on an incognito mode.

If you still face any issues, please write an email to support@cognitiveclass.ai with the following details

**Subject Line:** Feature Code Issue

**Email Content:**

## Practice exercise

Create a script named `greetnew.sh` that takes the first and last names of the user, saves them in corresponding variables `firstname` and `lastname`, and prints a welcome message, such as `"Hello <firstname> <lastname>"`.

Use the `read` command and `echo` commands. Write comments. Make sure to add the shebang line.

Step 1: Create a new file named `greetnew.sh`.

Step 2: Add the following lines to the file:

<pre><code>
      #! /bin/bash
      
      # This script accepts the user's name and prints 
      # a message greeting the user
      
      echo -n "Enter your firstname :"	  	
</code></pre>

Step 3: Save the file.

Step 4: Add the execute permission to `greetnew.sh` for the owner:

```
chmod u+x greetnew.sh
```

Step 5: Execute the file from the command prompt using the following command:

```
./greetnew.sh
```

### Summary

In this lab, you learned how to:
- Create and execute a simple Bash shell script
- Implement the shebang directive `#! /bin/bash` in a Bash shell script
