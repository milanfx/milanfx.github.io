### Topic01 - Definition and Nature of Data
- **Main Ideas:**  
  - Data refers to unorganized information that becomes meaningful once processed.  
  - It encompasses a wide range of elements including facts, symbols, and media.

- **Core Notes:**  
  - **Data** consists of **Facts**, **Observations**, **Perceptions**, **Numbers**, **Characters**, **Symbols**, and **Images**.  
  - When processed, data gains **Meaning** and becomes useful information.  
  - One primary method of classification is by **Structure**.

### Topic02 - Categories of Data Structure
- **Main Ideas:**  
  - Data is commonly categorized based on its structural organization.  
  - The three main types are: **Structured**, **Semi-Structured**, and **Unstructured**.

- **Core Notes:**  
  - **Structured Data**: Clearly defined schema; stored in databases.  
  - **Semi-Structured Data**: Partial organization with use of metadata or tags.  
  - **Unstructured Data**: No identifiable structure; highly heterogeneous formats.

### Topic03 - Characteristics of Structured Data
- **Main Ideas:**  
  - Structured data is the most organized form, often stored in relational databases.  
  - It supports easy data analysis and processing.

- **Core Notes:**  
  - Stored in **Schemas** such as **SQL Databases** and **Spreadsheets**.  
  - Represented in **Tabular Form** with **Rows** and **Columns**.  
  - Common sources:
    - **SQL Databases**
    - **Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) Systems**
    - **Excel** and **Google Spreadsheets**
    - **Online Forms**
    - **GPS Sensors**, **RFID Tags**
    - **Network and Web Server Logs**
  - Analyzed using **Standard Data Analysis Tools**.

### Topic04 - Features and Examples of Semi-Structured Data
- **Main Ideas:**  
  - Semi-structured data has partial organization using metadata but lacks a fixed schema.  
  - Cannot be stored in traditional tabular formats.

- **Core Notes:**  
  - Includes **Tags**, **Elements**, and **Metadata** for data grouping.  
  - Stored in **Hierarchical Formats** using **XML** and **JSON**.  
  - Common sources:
    - **E-mails**
    - **XML** and other **Markup Languages**
    - **Binary Executables**
    - **TCP/IP Packets**
    - **Zipped Files**
    - **Integrated Data** from Multiple Sources

### Topic05 - Nature and Sources of Unstructured Data
- **Main Ideas:**  
  - Unstructured data lacks a defined format, making it difficult to store in traditional databases.  
  - It is highly diverse and supports many business intelligence applications.

- **Core Notes:**  
  - Has no **Defined Format**, **Sequence**, or **Rules**.  
  - Cannot be stored in **Relational Databases**.  
  - Stored in **Files** and **NoSQL Databases**.  
  - Common sources:
    - **Web Pages**
    - **Social Media Feeds**
    - **Images** (e.g., **JPEG**, **GIF**, **PNG**)
    - **Videos** and **Audio Files**
    - **Documents**, **PDFs**, **PowerPoint Presentations**
    - **Media Logs**, **Surveys**

### ðŸ“Œ Takeaways
- **Data** becomes meaningful through **Processing** and exists in various forms.  
- Categorizing data as **Structured**, **Semi-Structured**, or **Unstructured** helps determine its storage and analysis method.  
- **Structured Data** is organized, easily analyzed, and typically stored in **Relational Databases**.  
- **Semi-Structured Data** uses **Tags** and **Metadata** for partial organization and is suited for **Hierarchical Storage** like **XML** and **JSON**.  
- **Unstructured Data** is highly varied, lacks formal organization, and often requires **NoSQL Databases** or **Manual Analysis** for interpretation.
