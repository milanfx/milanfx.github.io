### 05 - Reading: Evaluate Your Current Data Analytics Skills

#### Data analytics knowledge and skills 

Data analysts must have a comprehensive understanding of the data analytics process, as well as the technical skills that allow them to complete the data analysis process. In this section, you’ll consider questions about the data analytics process and specific technical skills to determine your readiness for the advanced certificate programs.

First, evaluate your knowledge of the data analytics process by considering whether the following statements apply to you:

- I have a thorough understanding of data-driven decision-making and how it helps organizations guide their business strategy based on facts. 
- I’m able to ask questions and make hypotheses about business problems and use them to guide me through the data analysis process.
- I know the steps to verify data credibility and perform data validation. 
- I understand data modeling and know how organizations use it as a tool to understand their data. 
- I can select and design visualizations that help me effectively communicate analysis insights to stakeholders. 

If the previous statements apply to you, you probably know the basics of the data analysis process. Continue reading to evaluate your technical skills.

Data analysts use a variety of tools, including software and programming languages, to analyze data. You will be most successful in an advanced certificate program if you’re able to use spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and R, which are covered in this program. Consider whether the following statements apply to you:

- I’m able to join data from multiple sources to use for data analysis.
- I can sort data in both a spreadsheet and a database.
- I’m able to clean data by ensuring it contains no duplicate or incorrect entries and is in the correct format.
- I know how to create data visualizations using a spreadsheet, Tableau, and R. 
- I can write a SQL command that would select several columns from a table.
- I understand packages in R and can select and install the packages I need to complete specific tasks.
