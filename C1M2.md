### 🗂️ Video - Big Data Processing Tools: Hadoop, HDFS, Hive, and Spark

#### ✔️ 01 - Big Data Processing Technologies Overview
- **Big Data Processing Technologies**: Technologies that enable working with large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
    - Used to derive value from Big Data.
- **Open-source Technologies**: Core tools discussed for big data analytics.
    - Apache Hadoop
    - Apache Hive
    - Apache Spark

#### ✔️ 02 - Apache Hadoop: Purpose and Architecture
- **Apache Hadoop**: A Java-based open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
    - Operates across clusters of computers.
- **Node**: A single computer in a Hadoop system.
- **Cluster**: A collection of nodes working together.
- **Scalability**:
    - Scales from a single node to many nodes.
    - Each node provides local storage and computation.

#### ✔️ 03 - Hadoop Capabilities and Use Cases
- **Hadoop Capabilities**:
    - Distributed storage and processing
    - Reliable, scalable, and cost-effective storage
    - No strict data format requirements
- **Supported Data Types**:
    - Structured data
    - Semi-structured data
    - Unstructured data
        - Streaming audio
        - Video
        - Social media sentiment
        - Clickstream data
- **Enterprise Use Cases**:
    - Real-time, self-service access for stakeholders
    - Cost optimization of enterprise data warehouses
        - Moving “cold” data to Hadoop-based systems

#### ✔️ 04 - Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: A distributed storage system for big data.
    - Runs on multiple commodity hardware nodes connected by a network
- **Core Characteristics**:
    - File partitioning across nodes
    - Parallel access to data
    - Fault tolerance through replication

#### ✔️ 05 - HDFS Data Storage and Fault Tolerance
- **File Partitioning**:
    - Large files are split into smaller blocks.
    - Blocks are distributed across multiple nodes.
- **Replication**:
    - Each block is replicated on multiple nodes by default.
    - Prevents data loss when a node fails
- **Example**:
    - A phone directory split alphabetically across different servers

#### ✔️ 06 - Benefits of HDFS
- **Parallel Processing**:
    - Computation runs on nodes where data is stored.
- **Data Locality**: Moving computation closer to data.
    - Reduces network congestion
    - Increases throughput
- **Additional Benefits**:
    - Fast recovery from hardware failures
    - High-throughput access to streaming data
    - Support for very large datasets
        - Hundreds of nodes per cluster
    - Portability across hardware platforms and operating systems

#### ✔️ 07 - Apache Hive: Data Warehousing on Hadoop
- **Apache Hive**: An open-source data warehouse software built on Hadoop.
    - Used for querying and analyzing large datasets
- **Storage Layer**:
    - HDFS
    - Other systems such as Apache HBase
- **Query Interface**:
    - SQL-based access to data

#### ✔️ 08 - Hive Use Cases and Limitations
- **Best Suited For**:
    - ETL
